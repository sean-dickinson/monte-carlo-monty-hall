# Monte Carlo Demo of the Monty Hall Problem

This is a simple demonstration of the monty hall problem to verify that switching your door after a goat has been revealed does indeed improve the probability of getting a car.

To learn more about the Monte Carlo method, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).

## Running The Code
```
./bin/run.sh
```

This bin stub will run the code in a fresh docker container and then remove it after it runs. You can edit the code and re-run the shell script and you can see your changes without worrying about rebuilding the container etc.
